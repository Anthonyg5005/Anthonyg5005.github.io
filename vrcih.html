  <h1>VRChat Instance History</h1>

  <p>This was made for windows directories so won't work on other os. this file will create an html page called "instance history.html" and will run as long as you keep the command promt window open. keeping it open will refresh the html page every 5 seconds. resources when testing: only takes up to 30 mb of ram, 0% cpu sometimes 1% or less every 30 seconds, 0% storage, 0% gpu sometimes 0.1% every 30 seconds (guessing sometimes uses gpu to proccess instead of cpu because of how my system is set up). This doesn't look the best but I'm trying to move it to be just the python file with no html. Picture below is an outdated image of VRChat-instance-history-V3</p>
